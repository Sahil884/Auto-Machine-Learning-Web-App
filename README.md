🚀 Automating Machine Learning Web Application
Streamlit
Python
PyCaret
Pandas Profiling

📖 Overview
This project is a web application that automates the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning model training.
With just a CSV file upload, the app generates a detailed profile report and trains multiple ML models automatically, selecting and saving the best-performing model.

✨ Features
- 📂 Upload CSV file as input
- 📊 EDA Report Generation using pandas-profiling
- 🤖 Automated ML Training with PyCaret
- 🏆 Best Model Selection & Saving
- 📥 Download Option for trained models
- 🔄 Supports both Regression and Classification tasks
- 🎨 Interactive Frontend built with Streamlit
